## Quick Setup Guide

1. Ensure the sensor firmware is updated to the latest version. You can do this through the Movella DOT app on either iOS or Android Devices.
2. Find your DOTs MAC address either through the btscanner.py script in the src folder or using the aforementioned app. Make sure that that is the address you input into the scripts as they are configured for my setup, so you'll need to change it.
